# Shop-Shop-Redux

# Description

`A refactor of the Shop-Shop application. The refactor is supposed to eliminate the use of the react Context Api mehthod to access and update the state(store). Ultimately in order to do this imports of redux methods must be done : createStore and Provider. I asertained that the component tree must also be refactored to use useSelector (selects data from the redux store) and to dispatch the changes in conjuntion with the useDispatch method.`
